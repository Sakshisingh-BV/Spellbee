## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- 🌐 Currently supports **English language only**. Multilingual support (e.g., Hindi or regional languages) is not yet implemented.
- ✏️ The grammar correction is not fully optimized — it may miss certain complex grammatical errors or provide partial corrections.
- 🧠 Context understanding is basic and may not handle idiomatic expressions, sarcasm, or highly nuanced text accurately.

We're continuously working on improving these aspects in future updates.
